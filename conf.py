# This file is execfile()d with the current directory set to its
# containing dir.

# Note that not all possible configuration values are present in this
# autogenerated file.

# All configuration values have a default; values that are commented out
# serve to show the default.

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
